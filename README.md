### 3. Create your Discord bot

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. New Application → Bot → copy the token
3. Enable **Message Content Intent** under Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents

## Usage

**Direct agent channels** — talk directly to one agent:
```
#rain → Rain, how do I set up a systemd service for this bot?
#midas → What would a launch tweet thread for Paperweight look like?
```

**Hub channel** — Pearl reads your message and routes it:
```
#hub → I need help figuring out pricing for my SaaS product
→ routed to Levy (monetization question)
```

**Commands** — works in any channel:
```
!crew agents           — list all agents and current models
!crew model rain llama3.1  — hot-swap Rain's model
!crew clear            — wipe your conversation history
!crew history          — see how much history you have
!crew help             — show all commands
```

## File Structure

```
pearl-crew/
├── bot.py          # Entry point, Discord event handling
├── agents.py       # Agent definitions, Ollama loop, tool execution
├── router.py       # Pearl's routing logic for hub channel
├── history.py      # Per-user conversation history (persisted to JSON)
├── tools.py        # Tool schemas + execution (search, files, shell, model switch)
├── commands.py     # !crew slash-style commands
├── workspace/      # Files agents can read/write
└── data/history/   # Persisted conversation history per user
```

---

## Swapping Models Per Agent

Edit `agents.py` and change the `model=` line for any agent, or use the live command:

```
!crew model rain llama3.1:70b
!crew model pearl mistral-small
```

---

## Recommended Models (Ollama)

For tool calling + less restriction:
- `hermes3` — NousResearch, strong tool use, less filtered
- `llama3.1` — strong tool calling natively
- `mistral-small` — fast, decent tools
- `qwen2.5` — strong tool use, fast

---

## Notes

- History is global per user — all agents share your conversation context
- History is capped at 40 messages to prevent context bloat
- File read/write is sandboxed to `./workspace/` 
- Shell commands have a basic blocklist — expand in `tools.py` as needed
- DuckDuckGo search requires no API key
